# IITC-Portals-Gallery
Portals Gallery is a plugin for agent-made Ingress Intel map known as IITC. It creates a list of currently rendered portals with its images, titles and positions. The main purpose of that plugin is to simplify the solving of Ingress First Saturday passcodes. But it can be used just for exploration of portal network of any place.

## Features
- See images, titles and coordinates of all rendered portals in that area
- Search portals by its names
- Sort them by title or by distance relative the specified location

## Todo
- ~Selecting the portal by clicking the map link~ (thanks, [tehstone](https://github.com/Kofirs2634/iitc-portals-gallery/pull/1))
- Updating the gallery after moving the map
- More sort terms... maybe
